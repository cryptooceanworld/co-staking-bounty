# Crypto-Ocean Bug-Hunter Event

Crypto-Ocean Bug-Hunter Event is taking place from March 12th And will last until we are satisfied that there are no more critical bugs. 

It is our pleasure to invite all of our community and all Solidity bug hunters to help us find vulnerabilities in Crypto-Ocean’s smart contract, Both game’s contracts which will be added later and our Staking to get WTR contract. 

Crypto-Ocean is a dесеntrаlized city builder strategy game running in the form of dApp on Ethereum blосkсhаin. Please refer to Crypto-Ocean;s WhitePaper for detailed game description and game rules: https://crypto-ocean.com/whitepaper.pdf

Rewards for vulnerability reports:

- Critical bugs – 20x Island/Land Plots + A high amount of WTR Tokens. 
- High Impact bugs – 5-10x Island/Land + WTR tokens. 
- Medium Impact bugs – 1-3x Island/Land + WTR tokens. 

Rewards will be minted in form of ERC-721 tokens prior to the game launch, so it will grant ownership of land plots on exclusive areas of the game map!

Additional rewards in Ether may be applied by the Crypto-Ocean’s team depending on the impact and overall risk severity of the bugs found by each participant. We don’t take the help for granted! 

Please report bugs via our discord user: CryptoOcean#9587

Or directly to Telegram contact: @CryptoOcean_WTR

We do not view this event as a competition! The CryptoOcean Team will promptly look at each bug, and will do everything in our power to fix any and all vulnerabilities that will be discovered. We will make sure that helpers are rewarded appropriately.


Thank you.
